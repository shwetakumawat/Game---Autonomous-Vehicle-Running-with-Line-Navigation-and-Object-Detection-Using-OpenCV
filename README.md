<h3 align="left">Introduction </h3>
 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> Mobility on a wide scale is moving towards complete automation. Though the technology for automating the vehicles already exists, these technologies must be optimised to fit the current environment.  This project would be a scaled-down model of the Autonomous Car and focus on the live streaming lane detection using OpenCV.</p>

<h3 align="left"> Project Limitations </h3>

 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> * Three wheels were used instead of four wheels. To build a three-wheel Car, three-wheeled was to have a mounting where the third wheel could be assembled. This mount is designed based on the space available on the model car. To provide the steering, a servo motor must be fitted so that the mounting used for the steering wheel could be extended for mounting the servo motor.</p>

</p> * camera mounting is required to place the camera in an optimal height to get the future images which would be adjacent to the vehicle.</p>

 ### ðŸ”‘ Prerequisites
 
* [Freenove 4WD Smart Car Kit](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/Freenove-Raspberry-Avoidance-Colourful-Ultrasonic/dp/B07YD2LT9D/ref=sr_1_5?crid=3VP3TDHEI052K&dchild=1&keywords=pi%20car%20kit&qid=1628421094&sprefix=pi%20car,aps,194&sr=8-5)

 ### ðŸš€ Initialization For Running the car Autonomously
 
 1. Clone the repo with local computer

```
git clone https://github.com/KrishArul26/Live--streaming-Autonomous-Vehicle-running-With-line-detection-using-OpenCV.git

```
 2. Connect the raspberry Module with local computer via Power shell(with wireless network)

```
ssh pi@car_name
``` 
 3.Navigate the Raspberry Module code directory 

```
cd ...
```  
```
cd share/Code
```  
4. For running the car: Run the main.py

```
sudo python main.py
```  
4. For visualization on the browser to see line detection: Run the app.py
 
```
sudo python app.py
