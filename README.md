# Game---Autonomous-Vehicle-Running-with-Line-Navigation-and-Object-Detection-Using-OpenCV

 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> Mobility on a wide scale is moving towards complete automation. Though the technology for automating the vehicles already exists, these technologies must be optimised to fit the current environment.  This project would be a scaled-down model of the Autonomous Car and focus on the live streaming lane detection using OpenCV.</p>
 
<p style= 'text-align: justify;'> * Three wheels were used instead of four wheels. To build a three-wheel Car, three-wheeled was to have a mounting where the third wheel could be assembled. This mount is designed based on the space available on the model car. To provide the steering, a servo motor must be fitted so that the mounting used for the steering wheel could be extended for mounting the servo motor.</p>
 
</p> * camera mounting is required to place the camera in an optimal height to get the future images which would be adjacent to the vehicle.</p>
